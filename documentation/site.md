## Front Page Management

The front page of the website has been designed to be easily customisable without needing to edit code. Here's how to manage each section:

### Hero Section

The top section of the homepage (hero section) can be fully customised through the WordPress Customiser:

1. Go to **Appearance → Customise → Homepage Settings**
2. Here you can modify:
   - **Hero Heading**: The main title displayed on the homepage
   - **Hero Text**: The descriptive paragraph below the heading
   - **Hero Background Colour**: Change the background colour of the hero section
   - **Hero Text Colour**: Change the colour of all text in the hero section
   - **Text Alignment**: Align text left, centre, or right
   - **Hero Section Width**: Adjust the width of the content area (50-100%)
   - **Hero Button Text**: The text displayed on the call-to-action button
   - **Hero Button URL**: Where the button links to (can be an internal page or external URL)
3. Changes will be visible in the preview and will go live when you click "Publish"

### Featured Home Posts

The middle section of the homepage displays posts from the "home" category:

1. **Adding content to this section**:
   - Create a new post (**Posts → Add New**)
   - Write your content and add a featured image
   - Assign the post to the "home" category
   - Publish the post

2. **Important notes**:
   - The homepage displays up to 6 most recent posts from the "home" category
   - Featured images are highly recommended for visual appeal
   - Use the excerpt field for a custom summary (otherwise, WordPress will use the first part of your content)

3. **Managing existing content**:
   - To see all posts in the "home" category, go to **Posts** and filter by the "home" category
   - Edit or delete posts as needed - changes will automatically reflect on the homepage

### Features Section

The bottom section of the homepage is available for additional content. This area is currently empty but can be customised by your developer to showcase specific content or features.

## Adding New Categories

If you wish to organise your content using additional categories:

1. Go to **Posts → Categories**
2. Add a new category
3. Assign posts to this category

Note that only posts in the "home" category will appear in the featured section of the homepage.

## Best Practices

1. **Featured Images**: Always use high-quality, properly sized images for posts that will appear on the homepage
2. **Consistent Content Length**: Keep excerpts and titles at consistent lengths for visual harmony
3. **Regular Updates**: Regularly update the "home" category posts to keep the homepage fresh
4. **Button Links**: Ensure the hero button links to relevant, up-to-date content

For any additional customisations beyond what's available in the Customiser, please contact your theme developer.
