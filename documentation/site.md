## Front Page Management

The front page of the website has been designed to be easily customisable without needing to edit code. Here's how to manage each section:

### Hero Section

The top section of the homepage (hero section) can be fully customised through the WordPress Customiser:

1. Go to **Appearance → Customise → Homepage Settings**
2. Here you can modify:
   - **Hero Heading**: The main title displayed on the homepage
   - **Hero Text**: The descriptive paragraph below the heading
   - **Hero Background Image**: Upload an image to use as the background (takes priority over the background colour)
   - **Background Image Overlay**: Adjust the darkness of the overlay on the background image
   - **Hero Background Colour**: Change the background colour (used when no image is set)
   - **Hero Text Colour**: Change the colour of all text in the hero section
   - **Text Alignment**: Align text left, centre or right
   - **Hero Section Width**: Adjust the width of the content area (50–100%)
   - **Hero Button Text**: The text displayed on the call-to-action button
   - **Hero Button URL**: Where the button links to (can be an internal page or external URL)
3. Changes will be visible in the preview and will go live when you click "Publish"

### Featured Home Posts

The middle section of the homepage displays posts from the **home** category:

1. **Adding content to this section**:
   - Create a new post by going to **Posts → Add New**
   - Write your content and add a featured image
   - Assign the post to the **home** category
   - Publish the post
2. **Important notes**:
   - The homepage displays up to six most recent posts from the **home** category
   - Featured images are highly recommended for visual appeal
   - Use the excerpt field for a custom summary (otherwise WordPress will use the first part of your content)

### Header Customisation

Your website header has been integrated with several customisation options to help you maintain a consistent and appealing look across your site. You can modify these options via the WordPress Customiser:

1. Go to **Appearance → Customise → Header Settings**
2. You can update the following:
   - **Header Background Colour**: Set the background colour of the header.
   - **Header Text Colour**: Change the colour of the site title and description.
   - **Header Padding (Height)**: Adjust the top and bottom padding of the header.
   - **Header Text Alignment**: Choose whether the text is aligned left, centre or right.
   - **Header Link Font Size**: Change the size (in pixels) of the navigation link text.
   - **Header Link Colour**: Set the colour of the navigation links.
3. Any changes made here will update the header appearance instantly in the preview. Click "Publish" to apply your changes.

## Adding New Content

### Pages

Pages are used for static content such as the About page, Contact page or any other information pages that do not change frequently.

- To add a page, go to **Pages → Add New**
- Enter your content and use the available meta boxes to customise the layout if needed (for example, overriding default page settings via **Page Settings** in the right sidebar).

### Posts

Posts are intended for regularly updated content such as blog entries or news updates.

If your website utilises an events calendar plugin:

- The events will usually be managed within a dedicated **Events** post type or via a calendar interface provided by the plugin.
