## Front Page Management

The front page of the website has been designed to be easily customisable without needing to edit code. Here's how to manage each section:

### Hero Section

The top section of the homepage (hero section) can be fully customised through the WordPress Customiser:

1. Go to **Appearance → Customise → Homepage Settings**
2. Here you can modify:
   - **Hero Heading**: The main title displayed on the homepage
   - **Hero Text**: The descriptive paragraph below the heading
   - **Hero Background Image**: Upload an image to use as background (takes priority over background colour)
   - **Background Image Overlay**: Adjust the darkness of the overlay on the background image
   - **Hero Background Colour**: Change the background colour (used when no image is set)
   - **Hero Text Colour**: Change the colour of all text in the hero section
   - **Text Alignment**: Align text left, centre, or right
   - **Hero Section Width**: Adjust the width of the content area (50-100%)
   - **Hero Button Text**: The text displayed on the call-to-action button
   - **Hero Button URL**: Where the button links to (can be an internal page or external URL)
3. Changes will be visible in the preview and will go live when you click "Publish"

### Featured Home Posts

The middle section of the homepage displays posts from the "home" category:

1. **Adding content to this section**:
   - Create a new post (**Posts → Add New**)
   - Write your content and add a featured image
   - Assign the post to the "home" category
   - Publish the post

2. **Important notes**:
   - The homepage displays up to 6 most recent posts from the "home" category
   - Featured images are highly recommended for visual appeal
   - Use the excerpt field for a custom summary (otherwise, WordPress will use the first part of your content)

3. **Managing existing content**:
   - To see all posts in the "home" category, go to **Posts** and filter by the "home" category
   - Edit or delete posts as needed - changes will automatically reflect on the homepage

### Features Section

The bottom section of the homepage is available for additional content. This area is currently empty but can be customised by your developer to showcase specific content or features.

## Footer Customisation

The website footer can be fully customised through the WordPress Customiser:

1. Go to **Appearance → Customise → Footer Settings**
2. Here you can modify:
   - **Footer Text**: Change the copyright text or add custom content
   - **Footer Background Colour**: Change the background colour of the footer
   - **Footer Text Colour**: Change the colour of all text in the footer
   - **Footer Padding**: Adjust the height of the footer by increasing or decreasing padding
   - **Footer Text Alignment**: Align text left, centre, or right
3. Changes will be visible in the preview and will go live when you click "Publish"

## Page Customisation

Individual pages can be customised both globally and on a per-page basis:

### Global Page Settings

These settings apply to all pages by default:

1. Go to **Appearance → Customise → Page Template Settings**
2. Here you can modify:
   - **Default Page Layout**: Choose between with sidebar, full width, or narrow content
   - **Show Page Title**: Toggle visibility of page titles
   - **Page Content Background**: Set the background colour for page content
   - **Content Padding**: Adjust the space around page content
   - **Featured Image Display**: Choose how featured images appear (banner, above content, background, or hidden)
   - **Default Heading Alignment**: Set text alignment for all headings (left, centre, or right)
   - **Default Body Text Alignment**: Set text alignment for all body text (left, centre, right, or justify)
3. Changes will be visible in the preview and will go live when you click "Publish"

### Individual Page Settings

For each specific page, you can override the global defaults:

1. Edit any page in WordPress
2. Look for the **Page Settings** box in the right sidebar
3. Here you can customise:
   - **Page Layout**: Override the default layout for this specific page
   - **Show Page Title**: Choose whether to display the page title
   - **Heading Alignment**: Set a different alignment for all headings on this page
   - **Body Text Alignment**: Set a different alignment for all body text on this page
4. These settings will only affect the individual page you're editing
5. Select "Theme Default" for any option to use the global setting from the Customiser

### Best Practices for Page Customisation

1. **Consistency**: Use global settings for most pages to maintain a consistent look
2. **Special Pages**: Use per-page overrides only for pages that truly need different styling
3. **Typography**: Keep text alignment consistent with your brand style guide
4. **Layout**: Choose full-width for landing pages and pages with large images
5. **Testing**: Preview pages on mobile and desktop to ensure good appearance at all screen sizes

## Adding New Categories

If you wish to organise your content using additional categories:

1. Go to **Posts → Categories**
2. Add a new category
3. Assign posts to this category

Note that only posts in the "home" category will appear in the featured section of the homepage.

## Best Practices

1. **Featured Images**: Always use high-quality, properly sized images for posts that will appear on the homepage
2. **Consistent Content Length**: Keep excerpts and titles at consistent lengths for visual harmony
3. **Regular Updates**: Regularly update the "home" category posts to keep the homepage fresh
4. **Button Links**: Ensure the hero button links to relevant, up-to-date content
