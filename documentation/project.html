  <h2>Goal/s</h2>
  <p>The goals of the website can be broken into two main categories - client goals and development goals.</p>
  <h3>Client Goals</h3>
  <p>The client (Baizonn Learning Centre) needed a website that could showcase their services in order to engage with new families.
    The client goal for this website was to increase the enrolment of students of all academic backgrounds from primary school to junior college. 
    More specifically, the website needed to:
    <ul>
      <li>clearly highlight the work done by the Baizonn Learning Centre</li>
      <li>show potential new clients upcoming events and the classes being offered</li>
      <li>allow interested customers to easily connect with the business.</li>
    </ul> 
    Therefore, the goal of the website was to streamline the process of finding and registering an interest in Baizonn Learning Centre classes, encouraging users to being the process of enrolling in the program. 
  </p>
  <h3>Development Goals</h3>
  <p>As well as producing a website that is able to satisfy the client goals there were a number of development goals that aimed to improve and guide the end solution.
    The website had a goal of creating a custom theme specfic to the Baizonn Learning Centre rather than utilising a standard theme available through WordPress. 
    Additionally, the website would utilise a customiser that would allow someone with no coding experience to modify the appearance of the website to suit the clients future needs.

  </ul>

  <h2>Local Environments</h2>
  <p>At the beginning of the project our team had two members attempt some local development in XXAMP whilst the other two members attempted this development in Docker.
     Each team member needed to understand the process of their local development environment, note the ease of use and be able to provide feedack as to whether it would be a useful tool for the project.</p>

  <h3>XXAMP</h3>
  <p>XXAMP was found to be very easy to setup after downloading the software. In order to run a local development environment the relevant files needed to be placed into the xampp\htdocs directory from the device drive. 
    Once in the folder the Apache and MYSQL modules in the XXAMP Control Panel could be started and the website visited at localhost/folder_name. This process meant that XXAMP was very easy to use and run different websites at the same time.</p>

  <h3>Docker</h3>
  <p>Similar to XXAMP, Docker was found to be very easy to setup with easy integration into Visual Studio Code (the preferred code editor for our team) to create the relevant .yml and .env files. 
    The control and updating of the website through the command line allowed the repository to be easily cloned and pulled from as required. </p>

  <p>For the project our team decided to maintain consistency and all utilise Docker for our local development. This allowed for simplified troubleshooting and file sharing with all team members following the same processes throughout their local development. 
    Docker was selected as the environment of choice due to the simplicity, clear steps to setup and clone repositories and the incorporation of a .env file to store passwords etc. that benefitted proejct management within the team.</p>

    <h2>AI Use Acknowledgement</h2>
  
    <p>
      I acknowledge the use of <a href="https://chat.openai.com/" target="_blank">ChatGPT</a> to assist in the development of a custom WordPress theme based on the 
      <a href="https://underscores.me/" target="_blank">Underscores starter theme</a>.
      This generative AI was used to guide implementation of specific theme features such as header customization, front-page layout, and other theme components.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Additionally, AI was used to generate visual illustrations throughout the website. These images were created using generative AI tools with carefully written prompts that convey the desired message or emotion for each section. Image descriptions and captions include the original prompts used to generate them for transparency and attribution purposes.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      For example, the following prompt was used to generate a testimonial-themed illustration:
      <blockquote>
        <em>"Generate a simple illustration with no text that encompasses 'Don't Just Take Our Word For It! Find Out What Parents and Students Think of Our Programs!'"</em>
      </blockquote>
    </p>
  
    <p>
      The following structured prompt was used to interact with ChatGPT. This prompt was designed to request context-aware, file-specific guidance for building and customizing WordPress themes:
    </p>
  
    <h2>Prompt:</h2>
    <div>
      <p>

        <strong>[**]</strong>.
      </p>
  
      <h3>Goal</h3>
      <p>
        Please help me customise this feature to match the following goal:<br>

      </ol>
    </div>
  
    <p>
      The outputs from these prompts were directly applied in building the theme and customising code within specific WordPress files such as 
      <code>header.php</code>, <code>functions.php</code>, and <code>style.css</code>. All outputs were reviewed, tested, and modified as needed to meet project goals.

  <h2>Comments</h2>
  <p>After team members made changes to the website in their local development environment the relevant pages would be exported and imported to the staging server. </p>
  <p>This server is where the majority of the development and refinement of the solution took place. </p>
  <p>This is the server that would be provided to the client to review our teams progress and seek feedback before progressing to the production server.</p>
  <p>All changes were to be made under the shrek profile.</p>

  <h2>Comments</h2>
  <p>The production server was the culmination of the project where the final website was published and reviewed by all team members.</p>
  <p>This is the server that would be provided to the client as the final product.</p>
